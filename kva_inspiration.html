		<h1>Inspiration</h1>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<h3>Claude Monet</h3>
				<p>Love at first sight, I would say. The works of Claude Monet led to my obsession with the light and cool breeze of Impressionism. <br />He was the founder himself of this art syle. Although I base my personal artwork on a realistic style, this is a painting style I admire greatly. <br />Just like Monet, I find inspiration in nature and beautiful scenery. He had talent like no other, and I aspire to have his deep knowledge of lighting and colors.</p>

				<h3>Pierre Auguste Renoir</h3>
				<p>I feel the happiest when I look at a Renoir. I wholeheartedly agree with his words, "Why shouldn't art be pretty? There are enough <br /> unpleasent things in the world." As another master of Impressionism, Renoir was able to capture the essence and femininity of a female face like no other. <br />His perfectly loose brushstrokes take me to my favorite place in the world, Paris. I dream of living inside his paintings, they seem perfectly peaceful and enjoyable.</p>

				<h3>Michelangelo</h3>
				<p>Not only the greatest of Renaissance times, but perhaps of all art history, is Michelangelo. At a mere 25 years of age he had taken<br /> on one of his most famous masterpieces, the David. The inexplicable artistic instinct he had to break a human form free from a slab of marble is awe-inspiring. <br /> I was fortunate enough to see the David in person, and I stood in awe  of every curve of his face, the veins in this arms, and sheer size of the sculpture.<br/> Having such an accurate knowledge of human anatomy and ability to render it in 3D is a skill I dream of having. <p>
